## Software Company File Review

### Observations:

1. The `SoftwareCompany` class is well-structured and follows Python best practices.
2. The use of Pydantic for data validation is a good choice.
3. The code is modular and follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
4. The logging mechanism is well-integrated.

### Suggestions:

1. Consider adding type hints for better code readability.
2. The `_check_balance` method could be more robust by handling different types of exceptions.
3. The `run` method could be optimized for better performance.

### Overall:

The code is well-written and adheres to best practices. However, there is room for improvement in terms of robustness and optimization.
